    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2 text-justify">
      Top Glove Corporation Bhd is the world's largest manufacturer of gloves, supplying protective and medical gloves globally.
    </p>
    <p class="text-gray-700 text-justify">
      During my internship at Top Glove Corporation Berhad as a Digitalization and Automation Engineer Trainee, I was exposed to a wide range of industrial automation technologies that greatly enhanced my technical skills and practical engineering knowledge. I worked hands-on with Omron PLCs (CP1E and NX1P2 models) and ABB ACS580 inverters, gaining valuable experience in configuring, programming, and debugging automation systems using CX-Programmer and Sysmac Studio. These tasks allowed me to understand how logic control and motor automation function within a real industrial environment.

One of my key contributions was developing an automatic latex oven cut-off system using photoelectric sensors and PLC logic to improve production line safety and efficiency. I was also entrusted to integrate the Wenglor B50S002 vision sensor for real-time defect detection and connect it with digital output components such as alarms and relays. Furthermore, I collaborated with the team to install Advantech WISE-4051 modules and 24VDC power supplies to enable IoT monitoring through Power BI dashboards, allowing live data collection and process tracking.

In addition to hands-on technical work, I contributed to panel design and assembly, including creating 2D layout drawings, wiring schematics, and Bills of Materials (BOM) using SolidWorks Electrical. I also took part in project delivery, testing, and troubleshooting at production sites, engaging directly with stakeholders such as engineers, technicians, and procurement teams to ensure smooth project execution. These real-world responsibilities helped me develop my problem-solving, communication, and documentation skills.

Overall, the internship provided a comprehensive learning experience that strengthened both my theoretical foundation and practical capabilities in industrial automation, IoT systems, and engineering project management.

    Designed and assembled a control panel using a photoelectric sensor, contactor, and relay with a Wise-4051 module to detect and count items on a conveyor. The system stops the conveyor automatically after reaching 85 items and sends count and timestamp data to a Power BI dashboard via the Wise-4051. A timer is added to prevent false double-counting by introducing a 2-second delay between counts.

  <p class="text-gray-700 text-justify">
    Developed a PLC-based automation system using Omron CP1E to control the latex oven based on former detection. Two photoelectric sensors detect the number of formers on the bypass and dipping tracks. Once 10 formers are detected on the bypass, the oven power is cut off automatically, and the system locks to prevent retriggering. A reset is triggered when the dipping track also detects 10 formers, unlocking the system. The system also includes a manual/automatic mode selector switch for operator flexibility.

    Worked on integrating an ifm PI1807 pressure sensor with four ABB ACS580 inverters to automate pump control based on RO tank water levels. Configured sensor digital outputs to trigger inverter start and stop based on set thresholds (e.g., 3m and 2.5m). The system includes relay interfacing, inverter parameter adjustments, and future expansion to cloud-based monitoring using the ECU-1251 gateway and ET-7002 module.

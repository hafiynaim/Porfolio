    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">About Hicom Diecasting</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2 text-justify">
      Hicom Diecasting Sdn. Bhd., established in 1985 and located in Shah Alam, is a leading Malaysian manufacturer specializing in high-pressure aluminum die casting and precision machining. The company operates with over 19 advanced die-casting machines and 100+ CNC machining centers, serving both local and international clients in the automotive, motorcycle, and industrial sectors. Hicom Diecasting is committed to quality, innovation, and continuous improvement, working closely with OEMs and Tier-1 suppliers to deliver high-performance components.
    </p>
    <p class="text-gray-700 text-justify">
      During my internship at Hicom Diecasting Sdn. Bhd., I was given the opportunity to be actively involved in various digitalization, automation, and production improvement projects. One of the major highlights was contributing to the AGYTEK-HDSB Modernization and Digitalization Project, where I helped implement the Enterprise Asset Management (EAM) system. This involved preparing machine and maintenance data, assisting with system configuration, and supporting the first IoT showcase dry run to present real-time production monitoring through dashboards.

I also gained hands-on experience in AI development, particularly in training an AI Vision Inspection system using YOLOv8 for defect detection on heat sink components. This enhanced my skills in computer vision, dataset handling, and model deployment for industrial quality control. In addition, I was involved in conducting cycle time analysis and building man-machine charts for robotic deburring operations. This allowed me to understand lean manufacturing concepts, identify bottlenecks, and propose improvements to boost process efficiency.

Apart from technical exposure, I also worked on data analytics using Minitab, supported automation workflow exploration using n8n, and developed small-scale web systems using PHP, MySQL, and Python for dashboard and monitoring solutions. The internship gave me valuable insights into real-world industrial environments, enhanced my problem-solving abilities, and strengthened my understanding of smart manufacturing systems and collaborative teamwork.

    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2 text-justify">
      Malay College Kuala Kangsar (MCKK) is a premier all-boys boarding school in Perak, Malaysia, established in 1905. Often referred to as the "Eton of the East," it was originally founded to educate the sons of Malay royalty and nobility. Today, MCKK is renowned for its academic excellence, leadership development, and strong traditions in sports and extracurricular achievements. The college continues to produce influential leaders across various fields in Malaysia and maintains a prestigious reputation nationally and internationally. 
    </p>
    <p class="text-gray-700 text-justify">
      During my time at Malay College Kuala Kangsar (MCKK), I was actively involved in both academics and co-curricular activities, which played a significant role in shaping my leadership and teamwork skills. As a member of the school’s rugby team, I developed discipline, resilience, and the ability to perform under pressure with qualities that continue to support my personal and professional growth.

I also actively participated in competitions, where I was awarded Champion in the Ecobot Competition and Key Fiesta, both held at UTAR, and received a Consolation Prize in the UNESCO Day Essay Writing Competition. These experiences honed my creativity, critical thinking, and public presentation abilities.

In addition, I was a member of Badan Nahdhah Islamiah (BANI), where I engaged in values-based leadership and spiritual development programs. My involvement in BANI further strengthened my communication skills, teamwork, and sense of responsibility.

Overall, my experience at MCKK equipped me with a strong academic foundation, competitive spirit, and leadership mindset that prepared me to thrive in higher education and future professional environments.

    The "Safe Car Vent" project utilizes an Arduino Uno to enhance in-car safety and comfort by automatically managing air circulation. The system monitors temperature and carbon monoxide levels using sensors, activating a fan and vent mechanism when either exceeds safe thresholds. This project aims to prevent hazardous conditions inside the vehicle, particularly during hot weather or in enclosed spaces, ensuring a safer environment for passengers and reducing the risk of carbon monoxide buildup.
